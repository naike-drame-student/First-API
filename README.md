# API Documentation
This is my first API project, built using Node.js, Express.js, UUID, Nodemon and Postman for testing.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the dependencies:
   `npm install express uuid nodemon`
3. Start the server:
   `nodemon api.js`

## Testing
To test the API endpoints, you can use a tool like Postman. Make sure the server is running, and then send requests to the appropriate endpoints with the required parameters and request body.

## Conclusion
This API project demonstrates basic CRUD operations for managing users. Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs. If you have any questions or feedback, please let me know.
